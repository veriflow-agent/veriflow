Async utilities for mixing sync and async code in Flask + gevent

This module provides utilities to properly handle async code in a Flask (WSGI) environment
running with gunicorn gevent workers.

THE CORE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES:
    Gunicorn gevent workers monkey-patch threading.Thread so it creates greenlets,
    not real OS threads. Multiple concurrent greenlets running in the same OS thread
    share the same threading.get_ident() value. This means a per-thread event loop
    dict causes concurrent jobs to collide on each other's loops, producing:
        "Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running"

THE SOLUTION:
    concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor creates REAL OS threads even under gevent.
    Each real OS thread gets its own isolated asyncio.run() call with its own event loop.
    asyncio.run() is specifically designed for "run a coroutine from scratch in a new loop"
    and handles all setup/teardown safely.

    The calling greenlet blocks on future.result(), which is gevent-safe -- gevent
    yields control to other greenlets while the real OS thread does async work.

Key utilities:
- run_async_in_thread: Run async code in a real OS thread (safe under gevent)
- cleanup_thread_loop: No-op kept for backward compatibility
- sync_to_async: Convert any callable (sync or async) into an awaitable

def run_async_in_thread(coro: Coroutine[Any, Any, T]) -> T:
    """
    Run an async coroutine in a real OS thread with its own event loop.

    This is the ONLY function you need to call to run async code from sync
    Flask routes or background task runners.

    Why real OS threads instead of asyncio loop reuse:
        Under gunicorn + gevent, threading.Thread creates greenlets. Multiple
        greenlets in the same OS thread share the same thread ID, so a
        per-thread loop dict collides between concurrent jobs. Real OS threads
        from ThreadPoolExecutor each have unique IDs and isolated event loops.

    Why asyncio.run() inside the thread:
        asyncio.run() creates a fresh event loop, runs the coroutine to
        completion, then closes the loop. This is the safest and simplest
        pattern -- no manual loop lifecycle management needed.

    Why future.result() is gevent-safe:
        Blocking on future.result() yields control to other gevent greenlets
        while the real OS thread does async work. No deadlock occurs.

    Args:
        coro: Coroutine to run

    Returns:
